The stl files for the vehicle have been removed from the case directory due to their size. 
The original DrivAer model files can be obtained by visiting the DrivAer (TUM) website listed in the README.md of this github repository. These can then be adapted for use in this case. We created a single stl for the vehicle body of choice (notchback, fastback, or estate) and four individual wheels. 

In the triSurface folder, place the DrivAer model components for the full body ("body1.stl") and the four wheels ("frontD.stl", "frontP.stl", "rearD.stl", "rearP.stl", e.g. "frontD" represents front Driver's side wheel).
